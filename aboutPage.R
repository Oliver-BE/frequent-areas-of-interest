The dataset tabulates location data for a set of users across the globe, but in Beijing in particular, in order to learn more about people's life patterns for machine learning tasks. This dataset contains 17,621 trajectories with a total distance of about 1.2 million kilometers and a total duration of 48,000+ hours. We attempted to wield this data to visualize the lives of people and their movements around Beijing for use in machine learning tasks. This dataset is obviously very large, and deployment with Rshiny has to consider the density of these data points.The dataset require these citations when their data is used.")),
